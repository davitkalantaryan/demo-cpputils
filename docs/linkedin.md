### The Problem

C++ developers rely on `std::shared_ptr` for safe and automatic memory management. However, a hidden limitation affects its usability in clean, encapsulated designs: if a class has a **protected or private destructor**, and you declare `std::shared_ptr<T>` as a `friend`, you would expect it to work.

It doesnâ€™t.

Despite granting friendship, the destruction fails at compile time because the actual deletion is performed by an internal type or lambda that is *not* a friend of the class. This behavior is consistent across GCC, Clang, and MSVC.

Hereâ€™s a minimal example:

```cpp
class TestClass {
    friend class ::std::shared_ptr<TestClass>;
protected:
    ~TestClass() = default;
public:
    TestClass() = default;
};

int main() {
    std::shared_ptr<TestClass> ptr(new TestClass());
    return 0;
}
```

This results in compiler errors stating the destructor is inaccessible.

### Why This Matters

In a large production system I developed, we relied heavily on `std::shared_ptr` for memory management. After a short break in development, I mistakenly deleted a pointer manually â€” forgetting it was owned by a shared pointer. The result: subtle crashes and time-consuming debugging.

To avoid such mistakes, I decided to enforce smart pointer-only ownership by making destructors protected. Unfortunately, standard `shared_ptr` made this impossible.

### My Workaround: A Smarter Smart Pointer

To address the issue, I created a custom `shared_ptr`-like implementation that:

* Properly supports friend-deletion of objects with protected/private destructors.
* Adds support for **reference count change notifications** â€” allowing advanced diagnostics or memory tracking.

GitHub links:

* Implementation: [sharedptr.hpp](https://github.com/davitkalantaryan/cpputils/blob/master/include/cpputils/sharedptr.hpp)
* Failing demo: [demo-cpputils](https://github.com/davitkalantaryan/demo-cpputils)

### What I Propose

1. Require `std::shared_ptr<T>` to handle deletion directly in its own scope (so `friend class std::shared_ptr<T>` is meaningful).
2. Optionally, extend `shared_ptr` to support callbacks on reference count changes. For example:

```cpp
using TypeClbk = std::function<void(void* clbkData, PtrType* pData, size_t refBefore, size_t refAfter)>;
```

### Formal Proposal

Iâ€™ve prepared a full WG21-style proposal:

### Iâ€™m Looking for Feedback

* Have you run into this limitation in your work?
* Would this help simplify and protect ownership models in your projects?
* Do you foresee risks with this change?

Feel free to comment or reach out on GitHub. Iâ€™m also in the process of contacting WG21 members for feedback and sponsorship.
